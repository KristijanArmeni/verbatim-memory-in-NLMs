To these queries we give the following reply , which , we doubt not , will rather surprise some of our readers . The salt of the ocean varies considerably in different parts . Near the equator , the great heat carries up a larger proportion of water by evaporation than in the more temperate regions . Thus , as salt is not removed by evaporation , the ocean in the torrid zone is salter than in the temperate or frigid zones . The salts of the sea , and other substances contained in it , are conveyed there by the fresh water streams that pour into it from all the continent of the world Here , as these substances can not be evaporated , they would accumulate to such a degree as to render the ocean uninhabitable by living creatures.The operations of the ocean are manifold . But we can not speak of these things without making passing reference to the operations of water , as that wonder-working agent of which the ocean constitutes but a part . Nothing in this world is ever lost or annihilated . As the ocean receives all the water that flows from the land , so it returns that water , fresh and pure , in the shape of vapour , to the skies . where , in the form of clouds , it is conveyed to those parts of the earth where its presence is most needed .

Thus , as salt is not removed by evaporation , the ocean in the torrid zone is salter than in the temperate or frigid zones . The salts of the sea , and other substances contained in it , are conveyed there by the fresh water streams that pour into it from all the continent of the world Here , as these substances can not be evaporated , they would accumulate to such a degree as to render the ocean uninhabitable by living creatures.The operations of the ocean are manifold . But we can not speak of these things without making passing reference to the operations of water , as that wonder-working agent of which the ocean constitutes but a part . Nothing in this world is ever lost or annihilated . As the ocean receives all the water that flows from the land , so it returns that water , fresh and pure , in the shape of vapour , to the skies . where , in the form of clouds , it is conveyed to those parts of the earth where its presence is most needed . After having gladdened the heart of man by driving his mills and causing his food to grow , it finds its way again into the sea : and thus the good work goes on with ceaseless regularity . When she got back , she read the list again : party , cable , heaven .
Before the meeting , Mary wrote down the following list of words : blessing , cabin , artist . After the meeting , Mary went for a walk . It was a busy day and she needed a break . Outside was really beautiful and warm and the flowers in the park were blooming . The sea has much to say ; far more than could possibly be comprehended in one volume , however large . It tells us of the doings of man on its broad bosom , from the day in which he first ventured to paddle along shore to the day when he launched his great iron ship , and rushed out to sea . Before proceeding to the consideration of the wonders connected with and contained in the sea , we shall treat of the composition of the sea itself and of its extent , depth , and bottom . What is the sea made of ? Salt water , is the ready reply that rises naturally to every lip . But to this we add the question , what is salt water ?

As the ocean receives all the water that flows from the land , so it returns that water , fresh and pure , in the shape of vapour , to the skies . where , in the form of clouds , it is conveyed to those parts of the earth where its presence is most needed .

Before the meeting , Mary wrote down the following list of words : factor , cotton , helmet , dinner , temple . After the meeting , Mary went for a walk . It was a busy day and she needed a break . Outside was really beautiful and warm and the flowers in the park were blooming . The sea has much to say ; far more than could possibly be comprehended in one volume , however large . It tells us of the doings of man on its broad bosom , from the day in which he first ventured to paddle along shore to the day when he launched his great iron ship , and rushed out to sea . Before proceeding to the consideration of the wonders connected with and contained in the sea , we shall treat of the composition of the sea itself and of its extent , depth , and bottom . What is the sea made of ? Salt water , is the ready reply that rises naturally to every lip . But to this we add the question , what is salt water ? To these queries we give the following reply , which , we doubt not , will rather surprise some of our readers . The salt of the ocean varies considerably in different parts . Near the equator , the great heat carries up a larger proportion of water by evaporation than in the more temperate regions . Thus , as salt is not removed by evaporation , the ocean in the torrid zone is salter than in the temperate or frigid zones . The salts of the sea , and other substances contained in it , are conveyed there by the fresh water streams that pour into it from all the continent of the world Here , as these substances can not be evaporated , they would accumulate to such a degree as to render the ocean uninhabitable by living creatures.The operations of the ocean are manifold .

Before the meeting , Mary wrote down the following list of words : event , learning , harvest , finger , perfume , supper , shower , pleasure , merchant , marriage . After the meeting , Mary went for a walk . It was a busy day and she needed a break . Outside was really beautiful and warm and the flowers in the park were blooming . The sea has much to say ; far more than could possibly be comprehended in one volume , however large . It tells us of the doings of man on its broad bosom , from the day in which he first ventured to paddle along shore to the day when he launched his great iron ship , and rushed out to sea . Before proceeding to the consideration of the wonders connected with and contained in the sea , we shall treat of the composition of the sea itself and of its extent , depth , and bottom . What is the sea made of ? Salt water , is the ready reply that rises naturally to every lip . But to this we add the question , what is salt water ? To these queries we give the following reply , which , we doubt not , will rather surprise some of our readers . The salt of the ocean varies considerably in different parts . Near the equator , the great heat carries up a larger proportion of water by evaporation than in the more temperate regions . Thus , as salt is not removed by evaporation , the ocean in the torrid zone is salter than in the temperate or frigid zones . The salts of the sea , and other substances contained in it , are conveyed there by the fresh water streams that pour into it from all the continent of the world Here , as these substances can not be evaporated , they would accumulate to such a degree as to render the ocean uninhabitable by living creatures.The operations of the ocean are manifold . But we can not speak of these things without making passing reference to the operations of water , as that wonder-working agent of which the ocean constitutes but a part .

To these queries we give the following reply , which , we doubt not , will rather surprise some of our readers . The salt of the ocean varies considerably in different parts . Near the equator , the great heat carries up a larger proportion of water by evaporation than in the more temperate regions . Thus , as salt is not removed by evaporation , the ocean in the torrid zone is salter than in the temperate or frigid zones . The salts of the sea , and other substances contained in it , are conveyed there by the fresh water streams that pour into it from all the continent of the world Here , as these substances can not be evaporated , they would accumulate to such a degree as to render the ocean uninhabitable by living creatures.The operations of the ocean are manifold . But we can not speak of these things without making passing reference to the operations of water , as that wonder-working agent of which the ocean constitutes but a part . Nothing in this world is ever lost or annihilated . As the ocean receives all the water that flows from the land , so it returns that water , fresh and pure , in the shape of vapour , to the skies . where , in the form of clouds , it is conveyed to those parts of the earth where its presence is most needed . After having gladdened the heart of man by driving his mills and causing his food to grow , it finds its way again into the sea : and thus the good work goes on with ceaseless regularity . When she got back , she read the list again : witness , squirrel , castle , platform , garden , member , mischief , message , mother , prayer .
Before the meeting , Mary wrote down the following list of words : window , feature , unit , bubble , riches , robber , cellar , kindness , anchor , climate . After the meeting , Mary went for a walk . It was a busy day and she needed a break . Outside was really beautiful and warm and the flowers in the park were blooming . The sea has much to say ; far more than could possibly be comprehended in one volume , however large . It tells us of the doings of man on its broad bosom , from the day in which he first ventured to paddle along shore to the day when he launched his great iron ship , and rushed out to sea .
