Mary was curious what were their first impressions of the town . The neighborhood felt very safe to them and they absolutely loved the park . This was only their second time visiting the park . There was so much to discover , so many winding paths and hidden gardens . It was not a big park by any means , but it offered a quiet refuge where one can escape the worries of everyday life . It also offered opportunities to do sports of all kinds . Young people from around the area played basketball , football , or volleyball . Others took part in outdoor workout sessions . Young families were going on a stroll with their children . Finally , there were so many people who brought their dogs for a walk . It was incredibly satisfying to see the joy our animal friends get when you throw them a ball . All this diversity of people and activities made a walk in this park a truly rewarding and relaxing daily routine . In fact , Sarah and Ryan were thinking of getting a dog .

During the walk , Mary could not stop thinking about the meeting . She was thinking about the discussions she had with her coworkers . Luckily , she met her neighbors Sarah and Ryan and they talked briefly . The couple has just moved to the area from a different city . Mary thought they were very a lovely couple and made good company . They were just getting to know the neighborhood and this was their first time in the park . Mary was curious what were their first impressions of the town . The neighborhood felt very safe to them and they absolutely loved the park . This was only their second time visiting the park . There was so much to discover , so many winding paths and hidden gardens . It was not a big park by any means , but it offered a quiet refuge where one can escape the worries of everyday life . It also offered opportunities to do sports of all kinds . Young people from around the area played basketball , football , or volleyball . Others took part in outdoor workout sessions . Young families were going on a stroll with their children . Finally , there were so many people who brought their dogs for a walk . It was incredibly satisfying to see the joy our animal friends get when you throw them a ball . All this diversity of people and activities made a walk in this park a truly rewarding and relaxing daily routine . In fact , Sarah and Ryan were thinking of getting a dog . They have not fully decided yet but they really wanted to spend more time outdoors . Mary liked dogs as well , but she was more of a cat person herself . She and her husband had two cats . One was two and the other four years old . They were very independent and spent most of their time outdoors . Mary thought having an animal was a great idea . They talked for a little bit and then Sarah and Ryan invited her to come over for a cup of coffee . Mary said she had time over the weekend . When she got back , she read the list again : darkness , football , olive , clothing , pony , farmer , contest , outline , success , orange .
