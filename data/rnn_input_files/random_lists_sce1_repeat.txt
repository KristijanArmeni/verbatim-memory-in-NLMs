It also offered opportunities to do sports of all kinds . Young people from around the area played basketball , football , or volleyball . Others took part in outdoor workout sessions . Young families were going on a stroll with their children . Finally , there were so many people who brought their dogs for a walk . It was incredibly satisfying to see the joy our animal friends get when you throw them a ball .

The couple has just moved to the area from a different city . Mary thought they were very a lovely couple and made good company . They were just getting to know the neighborhood and this was their first time in the park . Mary was curious what were their first impressions of the town . The neighborhood felt very safe to them and they absolutely loved the park . This was only their second time visiting the park . There was so much to discover , so many winding paths and hidden gardens . It was not a big park by any means , but it offered a quiet refuge where one can escape the worries of everyday life . It also offered opportunities to do sports of all kinds . Young people from around the area played basketball , football , or volleyball . Others took part in outdoor workout sessions . Young families were going on a stroll with their children . Finally , there were so many people who brought their dogs for a walk . It was incredibly satisfying to see the joy our animal friends get when you throw them a ball . All this diversity of people and activities made a walk in this park a truly rewarding and relaxing daily routine . In fact , Sarah and Ryan were thinking of getting a dog .
